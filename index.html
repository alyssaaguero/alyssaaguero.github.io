                     <h2>About</h2>
            
            <p>Ever since I was a little girl I was always experimenting with my personal style. I went through a   preppy phase, then a boho phase, an urban phase, and so on. But, no matter how many fashion trends I went       through, I always stayed true to my personal style. I believe that is the most important thing to remember as a fashionista. </p>

                  <p>I am a public relations junior at the University of Florida. This University has not only given me opportunities to improve my skills need for public relations practitioner, but has offered me opportunities to put those skills in use and display them as well. I run a fashion blog dedicated to college students looking for style tips. My ultimate career goal is to become a fashion publicist for top fashion designers. </p>

                  <p>This site shows the experience Iâ€™ve had, as well as the work I have accomplished. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. </p>
