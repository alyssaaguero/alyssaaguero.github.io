            <p>Ever since I was a little girl I was always experimenting with my personal style. I went through a preppy phase, then a boho phase, an urban phase, and so on. But, no matter how many fashion trends I went through, I always stayed true to my personal style. I believe that is the most important thing to remember as a fashionista. </p>

<p>I am a public relations junior at the University of Florida. This University has not only given me opportunities to improve my skills need for public relations practitioner, but has offered me opportunities to put in use and display those skills. I run a fashion blog and am slowly(?) making my way into the fashion world. My ultimate career goal is to become a fashion publicist for top fashion designers. </p>

<p>This site shows the experience I’ve had, as well as the work I have accomplished. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
